1.  nC0+nC1+nC2+nC3+.....+nCn= 2^n
2.  0*nC0+1*nC1+2*nC2+3*nC3+.....+n*nCn=?
    using contribution technique:
    found 1s contribution: 2^(n-1)== how many set 1 occurs
    found 2s contribution: 2^(n-1)== how many set 2 occurs
    ......
    ......
    found ns contribution: 2^(n-1)== how many set n occurs
    
    so overall result 0*nC0+1*nC1+2*nC2+3*nC3+.....+n*nCn=n*2^(n-1).
    
3. 0Cr+1Cr+2Cr+3Cr+4Cr+5Cr+6Cr+....+nCr= (n+1)C(r+1)
   Hockey Stick identity :
   if n=6 and c=3
   the answer is 7C4.
   if we choose 1 max and it's 7 then we choose let 3 in =6C3.
   if we choose 1 max and it's 6 then we choose let 3 in =5C3.
   if we choose 1 max and it's 5 then we choose let 3 in =4C3.
   if we choose 1 max and it's 4 then we choose let 3 in =3C3.
   others =0;
   so, 0+0+0+3C3+4C3+5C3+6C3=7C3
4.
   nCr=nC(n-r)
   because in every part we choose with nCr and without nC(n-r).
5.
   (nC0)^2+(nC1)^2+(nC2)^2+....+(nCn)^2=(2*n)Cn
   proof:
        if we do partition 2*n numbers in two groups (1,2....n) and (n+1,n+2,...,n+n)
        and we can choose n numbers from two groups
        * group-1   ----  group-2
           0                n     ==  (nC0)*(nCn) == (nC0)*(nC0)== (nC0)^2  [nCr=nC(n-r)]
           1                n-1   ==  (nC1)*(nC(n-1)) == (nC1)*(nC1)== (nC1)^2  [nCr=nC(n-r)]
           .......
           n                0    ==  (nC0)*(nCn) == (nCn)*(nCn)== (nCn)^2  [nCr=nC(n-r)]
           
           so,  (nC0)^2+(nC1)^2+(nC2)^2+....+(nCn)^2=(2*n)Cn.
6. # of factor of two in n!
   n/2+n/4+n/8+ n/16+.....  (takes floor value)
7. nCr%2=?
    you can do it using *6 ideas( using factor 2).
     Lucas Theorem:
      at first convert n and c in binary representation.
      then multiply all bit (n's ith bit C r's ith bit).
      like n=8,c=2
      8=1000
      2=0010
      so result is= 1C0*0C0*0C1*0C0,  [is there any 0C1 then it will be divided by 2]
      More specifically if r is a submask of n then it will not be divisable by 2.
          
     nCr% any prime under 10^6=?
        just convert mod number representation system.
      
    
8. # of ways permutation this sting ?
          AAABBBCCCDDEFF . length=14
          14C3*11C3*8C3*5C2*3C1*2C2 ways
          some modification it will be =14!/(3!*3!*3!*2!*1!*2!)
9. how many ways you can go to (0,0) to (n,m) cordinate(you can only up and right).
   main observations i need to move x axis n times and y axis m times.
   so just found the permuation of m times U and n times R.
   like n=2,m=3,
   son RRUUU = 5!/(2!*3!)
   if there are more than two dimension you will do just total moves time! / (x axis moves times!* y axis moves time! *.....)

   stars and bars theorem:
   you have n balls k bucket # of ways insert the ball into bucket such that every bucket has more than 0 balls
   n=5 ,k=3
    k1+k2+k3=n ; ki>=1
   .| .| . . .
   .| . . |. .
   so here . means start
   ans | mean bars .  total ways is (n-1)C(k-1).
        
   you have n balls k bucket # of ways insert the ball into bucket such that every bucket has any numbers of ball
   n=5 ,k=3
   k11+k22+k33=n ; ki>=0
   k11=k1-1,k22=k2-1,k33=k3-1
   k1-1+k2-1+k3-1=n
   ->k1+k2+k3=n+3=n+k
    so the result is (n+k-1)C(k-1)
       
    if every bucket has minimum ball requierd condition then
    just chage this (k1-x)+(k2-xx)=n equation.
        
    -------------------------------------------------------
        
    k1+k2+k3+k4+k5=n; 0<=ki<x
    
    for 0<=ki, total result is RESULT1= (n+k-1)C(k-1)  but some part is overlaping when ki<x .
        
    Now ki<x, this part we will do using exclusion and inclusion ,

    at first calculation # of way when just one ki>=x
      and the way is val1= kC1*(n-x+k-1)C(k-1)
    for second calculation,
                       val2= kC2*(n-(2*x)+k-1)C(k-1)
    after valk calculation Final value will be,
    RESULT2=((-k)^1)*val1+((-k)^2)*val2+((-k)^1)*val3+.....((-k)^k)*valk  ;  /// But some time we have not calculate overall val1 to valk . 
                                                                           Because (n-(x*kth)+k-1) will be <0 
    So, Final Result is = RESULT1-RESULT2

    Catalan Numbers:
    (i) you are given n opening bracker and n closing bracket # of ways  permutation this bracket sqquence such that it is a valid bracker sequence.
        we can do it by selecting the position.
        but it takes O(n*n) time.
         the form is Cn=summation of Ck*Cn-k-1 where k=0 to n-1. base case C1=1,C0=1. [it takes 0(n) times]
          In catalan number Cn=(1/(n+1))*(2nCn). [it takes 0(1) times]
         If you do google you can found more application of catalan numbers.
